# User guide

Publish a folder of Markdown notes as a browsable, searchable website — free, no server.

You write notes in a Git repository (your **content repo**). On every push, a GitHub
Action fetches **publictxt-pages**, builds the site, and publishes it to GitHub Pages.
Your repo stays plain Markdown: no theme, no build files, nothing to maintain.

## Guides

1. [Setup](setup.md) — content repo, Obsidian, first publish, local preview
2. [Configuration](configuration.md) — title, sections, filters, categories, and where each setting lives
3. [Writing](writing.md) — folders, front matter, tags, links, embeds, dates, drafts
4. [The published site](site.md) — what readers get: lists, filters, timeline, search
5. [Other editors](other-editors.md) — VS Code, the GitHub web editor, anything that writes Markdown

## Obsidian is the default, not a requirement

Everything here is plain Markdown in folders. Obsidian is the recommended editor because
its vault *is* a folder of Markdown files and its link and property formats match what
the site reads — but any editor works. See [Other editors](other-editors.md).
